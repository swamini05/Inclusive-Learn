Inclusive Learn is an innovative e-learning platform designed to cater to the needs of disabled students. The platform consists of three main modules aimed at providing an inclusive learning experience for students with disabilities.
The first module is a sign language detection model developed using Mediapipe, Tensorflow, and a normal classification model using Tensorflow. This model enables students with hearing impairments to communicate through sign language, making the learning process more accessible and inclusive.

The second module is an object detection model developed using YOLOv5. This module assists visually impaired students by identifying objects and their surroundings, making it easier for them to navigate and interact with their environment.

The third module is a voice assistant made using OpenAI's CHATgpt and Whisper AI. This module provides voice commands for students who may have difficulty using a keyboard or mouse, allowing them to access the platform more easily.

The frontend of the platform is developed using HTML and CSS, while the backend is built using Flask.

To run the Flask file and demonstrate the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the command: git clone https://github.com/swamini05/Inclusive-Learn.git
2. Navigate to the project directory using the command: cd Inclusive-Learn
3. Create a virtual environment using the command: python3 -m venv env
4. Activate the virtual environment using the command: source env/bin/activate
5. Install the required dependencies using the command: pip install -r requirements.txt
6. Run the Flask app using the command: flask run
7. Access the application by visiting http://127.0.0.1:5000/ in your web browser.

With these steps, you can run the Flask app and explore the Inclusive Learn platform's various features and modules.
